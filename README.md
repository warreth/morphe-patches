## Patches list

<!-- PATCHES_START EXPANDED -->

<!-- Do not modify this section by hand. The patch list is generated when release.yml creates a new release. -->

#### A list of your patches will automatically be shown here after your first patches release is created.

## Notes

- ScreenZen is distributed as an XAPK (split APK bundle). Use the XAPK, not a single APK.
- The patch adds Vanadium (`app.vanadium.browser`) and Cromite (`org.cromite.cromite`) to the
  browsers ScreenZen reads the address bar from, so website blocking works there too.
- ScreenZen still needs its Accessibility service enabled for website blocking to work.
- The in-app "Supported Browsers" dialog still shows the original list; only the actual
  blocking behaviour is patched.
